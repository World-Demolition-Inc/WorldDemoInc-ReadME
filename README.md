# WorldDemoInc-ReadME

This organization is dedicated to the demolition and domination of minecraft worlds all over through means of mass mineral extraction and general large scaled operations.

Most repositories held here will be made for mods which scripting is utilized such as Computercraft and OpenComputers.

If we find information that is worthy of having a writeup that would aid in our goals than it will be promptly made, mods that might fit that category are mods that do world altering actions such a buildcraft.

Suggestions for projects or changes to current projects are welcomed.

If you'd like to make a pull request to a current project then you are welcome to do so, it may or may not merge with the master branch.

If you'd like to submit a project and or join the organization than contact Jisatsu#1987 on discord. (Requestees wanting to join the organization will have to provide a sample of projects which falls in line with the organization's purpose.)

We do hope the resources provided by this organization will help aid you in your missions!

Remember, think destructive!

On a less serious note, I'd like to make it clear that this isn't a project I'll be super duper active on, whenever I work on my projects I'll either make a new repo or update one if it is already made. I'm also incredibly inexperienced with lua and in general with Computercraft, none of the projects you see posted by me will be super efficient, I'll try my best to document the scripts within a repo but I make no guarantees. The code will mostly work, I don't have faith that they will work a 100% but if people test the scripts out in their own environments and report their issues than I'll be able to up the likely hood of the script constantly working.

I hope my projects and other contributer's projects are helpful to you, if you're interested than as always you can submit your own project!
