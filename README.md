This organization is dedicated to the demolition and domination of minecraft worlds all over through means of mass mineral extraction and general large scaled operations.

Most repositories held here will be made for mods which scripting is utilized such as Computercraft and OpenComputers.

If we find information that is worthy of having a writeup that would aid in our goals than it will be promptly made, mods that might fit that category are mods that do world altering actions such a buildcraft.
